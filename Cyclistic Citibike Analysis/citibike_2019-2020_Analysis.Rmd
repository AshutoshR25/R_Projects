## Cyclistic Trip data Analysis 2019-2020


We will install the required and necessary packages for our research and Analysis.

```{r required packages, eval=FALSE, include=FALSE}
install.packages("tidyverse")
install.packages("ggplot2")
install.packages("lubridate")
```

## Libraries
Loading the required libraries
```{r Libraries, warning=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)  #helps wrangle data
library(lubridate)  #helps wrangle date attributes
library(ggplot2)  #helps visualize data
library(readr) 
```


## Working Directory
Setting the working directory to import the data from csv files into R
```{r working directory, echo=TRUE, warning=FALSE}
setwd("C:/Users/ashut/Desktop/My_projects/Google_data_analytics/Case_study-Citing Cyclistic Bike to Increase annual members/R")

getwd()
```

## Importing data
Importing the datasets.
```{r}
# Uploading Divvy datasets (csv files) into DF.
q2_2019 <- read_csv("Divvy_Trips_2019_Q2.csv")
q3_2019 <- read_csv("Divvy_Trips_2019_Q3.csv")
q4_2019 <- read_csv("Divvy_Trips_2019_Q4.csv")
q1_2020 <- read_csv("Divvy_Trips_2020_Q1.csv")

```


## Wrangling data

Comparing the column names of the files.

In order to combine the files into 1 single file we need same column names with respective data.
Hence observing the data.
```{r}
colnames(q3_2019)
colnames(q4_2019)
colnames(q2_2019)
colnames(q1_2020)
```


### Observation
We can see that the column names of q3, q2, q4-2019 does not match the most recent and fresh q1_2020.

**Note** - The column order does not matter. The column name must match what data you want to bind together into one.


- In order to match the column names and data in the file -
  - Rename the columns
  - Combine the data in all files into one.


```{r Columns rename}
# Renaming the column names as to match file q1_2020

(q4_2019 <- rename(q4_2019
                   ,ride_id = trip_id
                   ,rideable_type = bikeid 
                   ,started_at = start_time  
                   ,ended_at = end_time  
                   ,start_station_name = from_station_name 
                   ,start_station_id = from_station_id 
                   ,end_station_name = to_station_name 
                   ,end_station_id = to_station_id 
                   ,member_casual = usertype))

(q3_2019 <- rename(q3_2019
                   ,ride_id = trip_id
                   ,rideable_type = bikeid 
                   ,started_at = start_time  
                   ,ended_at = end_time  
                   ,start_station_name = from_station_name 
                   ,start_station_id = from_station_id 
                   ,end_station_name = to_station_name 
                   ,end_station_id = to_station_id 
                   ,member_casual = usertype))

(q2_2019 <- rename(q2_2019
                   ,ride_id = "01 - Rental Details Rental ID"
                   ,rideable_type = "01 - Rental Details Bike ID" 
                   ,started_at = "01 - Rental Details Local Start Time"  
                   ,ended_at = "01 - Rental Details Local End Time"  
                   ,start_station_name = "03 - Rental Start Station Name" 
                   ,start_station_id = "03 - Rental Start Station ID"
                   ,end_station_name = "02 - Rental End Station Name" 
                   ,end_station_id = "02 - Rental End Station ID"
                   ,member_casual = "User Type"))

```



Looking at the data sets with the **changed** column names.

```{r Inspecting Dataframes}
# look for incongruencies, if any

glimpse(q1_2020)
glimpse(q4_2019)
glimpse(q3_2019)
glimpse(q2_2019)
```


### Now, the column names **matches**.

But, the assignment of data type to ride_id and rideable_type is **dbl**, which doesnot match the data type of file q1_2020.

- Changing data type from dbl to character.
  - ride_id
  - rideable_type
  
```{r datatype-change}
q4_2019 <-  mutate(q4_2019, ride_id = as.character(ride_id)
                   ,rideable_type = as.character(rideable_type)) 
q3_2019 <-  mutate(q3_2019, ride_id = as.character(ride_id)
                   ,rideable_type = as.character(rideable_type)) 
q2_2019 <-  mutate(q2_2019, ride_id = as.character(ride_id)
                   ,rideable_type = as.character(rideable_type)) 

```


### Combing the data in Rows into 1 single file

```{r}
# Adding up quarter's data frames into one big data frame
all_trips <- bind_rows(q2_2019, q3_2019, q4_2019, q1_2020)

# Remove lat, long, birthyear, and gender fields as this data is not in 2020 datasets.
all_trips <- all_trips %>%  
  select(-c(start_lat, start_lng, end_lat, end_lng, birthyear, gender, "01 - Rental Details Duration In Seconds Uncapped", "05 - Member Details Member Birthday Year", "Member Gender", "tripduration"))

```


## Preparing Data for Analysis.

### Observing our file.

```{r}
#List of column names
colnames(all_trips)
```


```{r}
#Rows in our data frame.
nrow(all_trips)  
```

```{r}
head(all_trips)
```
```{r}
tail(all_trips)
```

```{r}
# Basic layout of columns there types and data.
str(all_trips)
```

```{r}
# With this we will get majority of the basic statistical data we need to know about our columns in our dataframe.
summary(all_trips)

```


## Correcting Errors.

- Data gaps Found -
  - The terms in member_casual used before 2020 data is different.
  - ride length and days on which ride took place.
  
```{r}
table(all_trips$member_casual)

```

Here we can observe the column should had only 2 values but there are 4 terms.

Hence, combining Subscriber into member and Customer into casual.

```{r combining values}
all_trips <- all_trips %>%
  mutate(member_casual = recode(member_casual
                          ,"Subscriber" = "member"
                          ,"Customer" = "casual"))

table(all_trips$member_casual)
```





# Adding Information {.tabset}
## Date Column

### Adding columns that will list the date, month, day, and year of each ride
 
This will allow us to aggregate ride data for each month, day, or year ... before completing these operations we could only aggregate at the ride level




```{r date columns}
#Getting into default format i.e. yyyy-mm-dd
all_trips$date <- as.Date(all_trips$started_at)


# Getting month out of date
all_trips$month <- format(as.Date(all_trips$date), "%m")


# Getting day out of the date
all_trips$day <- format(as.Date(all_trips$date), "%d")


# Getting Year out of date
all_trips$year <- format(as.Date(all_trips$date), "%Y")


#Getting which day was it on that date
all_trips$day_of_week <- format(as.Date(all_trips$date), "%A")

```


## Ride Length 


Adding a "ride_length" column with calculation to all_trips (in seconds)

```{r ride_length}
all_trips$ride_length <- difftime(all_trips$ended_at,all_trips$started_at)

glimpse(all_trips)
# str(all_trips)
```


As we can observe the data is in the time - double format and seconds added.
It is good to visualize and understand but not useful for calculations.

Hence,
- Converting "ride_length" from double to numeric so that we can run calculations on the data.

```{r conversion - fac to num}
is.double(all_trips$ride_length)

all_trips$ride_length <- as.numeric(as.character(all_trips$ride_length))

is.numeric(all_trips$ride_length)
```

# New Clear And Clean Dataset

As the dataset contained a few hundred entries when bikes were taken out of docks and checked for quality by Divvy or ride_length was negative.

A new version of updated data set will be needed for our Analysis.
```{r}
all_trips_v2 <- all_trips[!(all_trips$start_station_name == "HQ QR" | all_trips$ride_length<0),]

glimpse(all_trips_v2)
```


# Statistical Analysis {.tabset}

## Mean

This is the Average of total ride_length / rides
```{r mean ride_length}
mean(all_trips_v2$ride_length) #average (total ride length / rides)

```

## Midpoint

This is showing the midpoint of the ride_length
```{r}
median(all_trips_v2$ride_length) #midpoint number in the ascending array of ride lengths
```

## Min

This is showing the shortest ride in Seconds.
```{r}
min(all_trips_v2$ride_length) #min of ride_length
```



## Max

This is showing the longest ride in Seconds.
```{r}
max(all_trips_v2$ride_length) #max of ride_length
```



## Summary 

All the mean, median, min and max in one place.
```{r}
summary(all_trips_v2$ride_length)
```



# Annual v/s Casual Members

```{r}
aggregate(all_trips_v2$ride_length ~ all_trips_v2$member_casual, FUN = mean)
aggregate(all_trips_v2$ride_length ~ all_trips_v2$member_casual, FUN = median)
aggregate(all_trips_v2$ride_length ~ all_trips_v2$member_casual, FUN = max)
aggregate(all_trips_v2$ride_length ~ all_trips_v2$member_casual, FUN = min)

```




### Based on days 
#### Ride Length of Casual and Annual members
```{r days ride length members}
aggregate(all_trips_v2$ride_length ~ all_trips_v2$member_casual + all_trips_v2$day_of_week, FUN = mean)
```

Here the days are in random order.
So we will **order them in a generalized format** for easy viewing.



```{r Ordering days}
all_trips_v2$day_of_week <- ordered(all_trips_v2$day_of_week, levels=c("Sunday", "Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday", "Saturday"))
```


Now visualizing clearly.
The average ride time by each day for members vs casual users.

```{r}

#the average ride time by each day for members vs casual users

aggregate(all_trips_v2$ride_length ~ all_trips_v2$member_casual + all_trips_v2$day_of_week, FUN = mean)
```



# New version of data -v3

Now, we want to plot the data and get insights from the data.

```{r warning=FALSE}
all_trips_v3 <- all_trips_v2 %>% 
  mutate(weekday = wday(started_at, label = TRUE)) %>%  #creates weekday field using wday()
  group_by(member_casual, weekday) %>%                  #groups by user type and weekday
  summarise(number_of_rides = n()							#calculates the number of rides and average duration 
  ,average_duration = mean(ride_length)) %>% 		        # calculates the average duration
  arrange(member_casual, weekday)		
```


```{r}
(all_trips_v3)
```




# Visualization {.tabset}

## Number of rides by rider type

```{r no. of rides v/s weekday}
# Plot of No. of rides v/s week days - based on members.
all_trips_v3 %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = weekday, y = number_of_rides, fill = member_casual)) +
  geom_col(position = "dodge")

```


## Average duration

```{r}
all_trips_v3 %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = weekday, y = average_duration, fill = member_casual)) +
  geom_col(position = "dodge")
```


# Results 

- Based on the data and Visualizations -
  - Based on Number of rides, We observe that **Member** uses bikes more **from Monday to Friday**, while **casual members** use bikes more on **saturdays and sundays**.
  - Based on duration **Casual members** uses bikes for approximately **58 Minutes and 15 seconds**. And **Annual members** uses bikes for approximately **16 Minutes and 35 seconds**.


# Further Analysis

## If required - for download

```{r csv downloading}
# Just remove the comments and input your download location for your analysis..

# write.csv(all_trips_v3, file = 'avg_ride_length.csv')

```
